Self-driving cars require a deep understanding of their surroundings.
To support this, camera frames are used to recognize the road, pedestrians, cars, and sidewalks at a pixel-level accuracy.

In this work I am trying to use `U-Net` to solve the problem of semantic segmentation: `0` — not a car, `1` — car.
